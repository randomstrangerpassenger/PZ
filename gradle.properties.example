# The build system will automatically detect your game installation
# by reading Steam's library configuration. You only need to set
# this if:
#   1. You installed the game outside of Steam
#   2. Auto-detection is not working for some reason
#
# Examples:
#   pzHome=C:/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/ProjectZomboid
#   pzHome=D:/Games/ProjectZomboid
#   pzHome=/home/user/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/ProjectZomboid
#
# Uncomment and modify the line below if needed:
# pzHome=YOUR_GAME_PATH_HERE
